After the removals, you insert the remaining elements of nums1 and nums2 into a set s.\\nReturn the maximum possible size of the set s.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,1,2], nums2 = [1,1,1,1]\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation: We remove two occurences of 1 from nums1 and nums2. After the removals, the arrays become equal to nums1 = [2,2] and nums2 = [1,1]. Therefore, s = {1,2}.\\nIt can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible size of the set s after the removals.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [2,3,2,3,2,3]\\nOutput: 5\\nExplanation: We remove 2, 3, and 6 from nums1, as well as 2 and two occurrences of 3 from nums2. After the removals, the arrays become equal to nums1 = [1,4,5] and nums2 = [2,3,2]. Therefore, s = {1,2,3,4,5}.\\nIt can be shown that 5 is the maximum possible size of the set s after the removals.\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: nums1 = [1,1,2,2,3,3], nums2 = [4,4,5,5,6,6]\\nOutput: 6\\nExplanation: We remove 1, 2, and 3 from nums1, as well as 4, 5, and 6 from nums2. After the removals, the arrays become equal to nums1 = [1,2,3] and nums2 = [4,5,6]. Therefore, s = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.\\nIt can be shown that 6 is the maximum possible size of the set s after the removals.\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\nn == nums1.length == nums2.length\\n1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4\\nn is even.\\n1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maximumSetSize(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

Your task is to mark all indices in nums.\\nIn each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:\\n\\nChoose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.\\nIf nums[changeIndices[s]] is equal to 0, mark the index changeIndices[s].\\nDo nothing.\\n\\nReturn an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]\\nOutput: 8\\nExplanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\\nSecond 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].\\nSecond 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0].\\nSecond 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].\\nSecond 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].\\nSecond 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\\nSecond 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\\nSecond 7: Do nothing.\\nSecond 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\\nNow all indices have been marked.\\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second.\\nHence, the answer is 8.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums = [1,3], changeIndices = [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]\\nOutput: 6\\nExplanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds.

If multiple such elements exist, mark the ones with the smallest indices.

When the game starts, Alice picks up any index aliceIndex in the range [0, n - 1] and stands there. If nums[aliceIndex] == 1 , Alice picks up the one and nums[aliceIndex] becomes 0(this does not count as a move). After this, Alice can make any number of moves (including zero) where in each move Alice must perform exactly one of the following actions:\\n\\nSelect any index j != aliceIndex such that nums[j] == 0 and set nums[j] = 1. This action can be performed at most maxChanges times.\\nSelect any two adjacent indices x and y (|x - y| == 1) such that nums[x] == 1, nums[y] == 0, then swap their values (set nums[y] = 1 and nums[x] = 0). If y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one after this move and nums[y] becomes 0.\\n\\nReturn the minimum number of moves required by Alice to pick exactly k ones.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k = 3, maxChanges = 1\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: Alice can pick up 3 ones in 3 moves, if Alice performs the following actions in each move when standing at aliceIndex == 1:\\n\\n At the start of the game Alice picks up the one and nums[1] becomes 0. nums becomes [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].\\nSelect j == 2 and perform an action of the first type. nums becomes [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]\\nSelect x == 2 and y == 1, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. As y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one and nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].\\nSelect x == 0 and y == 1, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. As y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one and nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].\\n\\nNote that it may be possible for Alice to pick up 3 ones using some other sequence of 3 moves.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums = [0,0,0,0], k = 2, maxChanges = 3\\nOutput: 4\\nExplanation: Alice can pick up 2 ones in 4 moves, if Alice performs the following actions in each move when standing at aliceIndex == 0:\\n\\nSelect j == 1 and perform an action of the first type. nums becomes [0,1,0,0].\\nSelect x == 1 and y == 0, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [1,0,0,0].

For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.\\nYou need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.\\nReturn the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: arr1 = [1,10,100], arr2 = [1000]\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: There are 3 pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]):\\n- The longest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.\\n- The longest common prefix of (10, 1000) is 10.\\n- The longest common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.\\nThe longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]\\nOutput: 0\\nExplanation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we return 0.\\nNote that common prefixes between elements of the same array do not count.\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\n1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 5 * 10^4\\n1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^8\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def longestCommonPrefix(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> int:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

Some of the levels in the game are impossible to clear while others can always be cleared. In particular, if possible[i] == 0, then the i^th level is impossible to clear for both the players. A player gains 1 point on clearing a level and loses 1 point if the player fails to clear it.\\nAt the start of the game, Alice will play some levels in the given order starting from the 0^th level, after which Bob will play for the rest of the levels.\\nAlice wants to know the minimum number of levels she should play to gain more points than Bob, if both players play optimally to maximize their points.\\nReturn the minimum number of levels Alice should play to gain more points. If this is not possible, return -1.\\nNote that each player must play at least 1 level.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: possible = [1,0,1,0]\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation:\\nLet's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:\\n\\nIf Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 point.\\nIf Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 = 0 points, while Bob has 1 - 1 = 0 points.\\nIf Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 point, while Bob has -1 point.\\n\\nAlice must play a minimum of 1 level to gain more points.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: possible = [1,1,1,1,1]\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation:\\nLet's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:\\n\\nIf Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has 4 points.\\nIf Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 2 points, while Bob has 3 points.\\nIf Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 3 points, while Bob has 2 points.\\nIf Alice plays till level 3 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 4 points, while Bob has 1 point.\\n\\nAlice must play a minimum of 3 levels to gain more points.\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: possible = [0,0]\\nOutput: -1\\nExplanation:\\nThe only possible way is for both players to play 1 level each.

The uniqueness array of nums is the sorted array that contains the number of distinct elements of all the subarrays of nums. In other words, it is a sorted array consisting of distinct(nums[i..j]), for all 0 <= i <= j < nums.length.\\nHere, distinct(nums[i..j]) denotes the number of distinct elements in the subarray that starts at index i and ends at index j.\\nReturn the median of the uniqueness array of nums.\\nNote that the median of an array is defined as the middle element of the array when it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If there are two choices for a median, the smaller of the two values is taken.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation:\\nThe uniqueness array of nums is [distinct(nums[0..0]), distinct(nums[1..1]), distinct(nums[2..2]), distinct(nums[0..1]), distinct(nums[1..2]), distinct(nums[0..2])] which is equal to [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]. The uniqueness array has a median of 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums = [3,4,3,4,5]\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation:\\nThe uniqueness array of nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]. The uniqueness array has a median of 2.

You have two integer arrays, nums and freq, of equal length n. Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.\\n\\nAddition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are added to the collection at step i.\\nRemoval of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i.\\n\\nReturn an array ans of length n, where ans[i] represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the i^th step. If the collection is empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1]\\nOutput: [3,3,2,2]\\nExplanation:\\nAfter step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2.

So ans[2] = 2.\\nAfter step 3, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3 and 1 ID with the value of 1. So ans[3] = 2.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums = [5,5,3], freq = [2,-2,1]\\nOutput: [2,0,1]\\nExplanation:\\nAfter step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2.\\nAfter step 1, there are no IDs. So ans[1] = 0.\\nAfter step 2, we have 1 ID with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 1.\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\n1 <= nums.length == freq.length <= 10^5\\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5\\n-10^5 <= freq[i] <= 10^5\\nfreq[i] != 0\\nThe input is generated such that the occurrences of an ID will not be negative in any step.\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def mostFrequentIDs(self, nums: List[int], freq: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

If there are two or more strings in wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the smallest in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred earlier in wordsContainer.\\nReturn an array of integers ans, where ans[i] is the index of the string in wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i].\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: wordsContainer = [\\\"abcd\\\",\\\"bcd\\\",\\\"xbcd\\\"], wordsQuery = [\\\"cd\\\",\\\"bcd\\\",\\\"xyz\\\"]\\nOutput: [1,1,1]\\nExplanation:\\nLet's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:\\n\\nFor wordsQuery[0] = \\\"cd\\\", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix \\\"cd\\\" are at indices 0, 1, and 2.

Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.\\nFor wordsQuery[2] = \\\"xyz\\\", there is no string from wordsContainer that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is \\\"\\\", that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2.

The key insight is that the ball will move back and forth between the children, so we can use the modulo operator to find the position of the child who receives the ball.\n\nThe expression `(k % ((n - 1) * 2))` calculates the number of steps the ball has moved, taking into account the reversals in direction.

The key insight is that the ball will move back and forth between the children, and the direction of the movement will change every n-1 seconds. Therefore, we can use the modulo operator to find the position of the child who receives the ball after k seconds.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n* `(k % ((n - 1) * 2))` finds the position of the child who receives the ball after k seconds, assuming the direction of the movement is always to the right. This is because the ball will move n-1 steps to the right, then n-1 steps to the left, and so on.\n* `if k % ((n - 1) * 2) != 0 else 0` handles the case where k is a multiple of `(n - 1) * 2`, in which case the ball will be back at child 0.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large inputs.",

The length of this pattern is `(n - 1) * 2`, because the ball moves `n - 1` steps to the right and then `n - 1` steps to the left.\n\nBy taking the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the pattern, we can find the position of the ball in the current cycle.

The dynamic programming table `dp` is of size `(n+1) x 51`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of monotonic pairs for the first `i` elements of `nums` and the sum of the first element of `arr1` and `arr2` is `j`.

You are given two integers kx and ky where (kx, ky) denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array positions where positions[i] = [x_i, y_i] denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.\\nAlice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:\\n\\nThe player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves. Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves.\\nIn the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them. Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.\\n\\nAlice is trying to maximize the sum of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to minimize them.\\nReturn the maximum total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play optimally.\\nNote that in one move, a chess knight has eight possible positions it can move to, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.\\n\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: kx = 1, ky = 1, positions = [[0,0]]\\nOutput: 4\\nExplanation:\\n\\nThe knight takes 4 moves to reach the pawn at (0, 0).\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: kx = 0, ky = 2, positions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]\\nOutput: 8\\nExplanation:\\n\\n\\nAlice picks the pawn at (2, 2) and captures it in two moves: (0, 2) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 2).\\nBob picks the pawn at (3, 3) and captures it in two moves: (2, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 3).\\nAlice picks the pawn at (1, 1) and captures it in four moves: (3, 3) -> (4, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 1).\\n\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: kx = 0, ky = 0, positions = [[1,2],[2,4]]\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation:\\n\\nAlice picks the pawn at (2, 4) and captures it in two moves: (0, 0) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 4). Note that the pawn at (1, 2) is not captured.\\nBob picks the pawn at (1, 2) and captures it in one move: (2, 4) -> (1, 2).\\n\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\n0 <= kx, ky <= 49\\n1 <= positions.length <= 15\\npositions[i].length == 2\\n0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 49\\nAll positions[i] are unique.\\nThe input is generated such that positions[i] != [kx, ky] for all 0 <= i < positions.length.\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxMoves(self, kx: int, ky: int, positions: List[List[int]]) -> int:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. The state of each cell is represented by the character A_{i,j}, which means the following:\\n\\n- .: An empty cell.\\n- #: An obstacle.\\n- S: An empty cell and the start point.\\n- T: An empty cell and the goal point.\\n\\nTakahashi can move from his current cell to a vertically or horizontally adjacent empty cell by consuming 1 energy. He cannot move if his energy is 0, nor can he exit the grid.\\nThere are N medicines in the grid. The i-th medicine is at the empty cell (R_i, C_i) and can be used to set the energy to E_i. Note that the energy does not necessarily increase. He can use the medicine in his current cell. The used medicine will disappear.\\nTakahashi starts at the start point with 0 energy and wants to reach the goal point. Determine if this is possible.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nH W\\r\\nA_{1, 1}A_{1, 2}\\\\cdotsA_{1, W}\\r\\nA_{2, 1}A_{2, 2}\\\\cdotsA_{2, W}\\r\\n\\\\vdots\\r\\nA_{H, 1}A_{H, 2}\\\\cdotsA_{H, W}\\r\\nN\\r\\nR_1 C_1 E_1\\r\\nR_2 C_2 E_2\\r\\n\\\\vdots\\r\\nR_N C_N E_N\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf Takahashi can reach the goal point from the start point, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 1 \\\\leq H, W \\\\leq 200\\n- A_{i, j} is one of ., #, S, and T.\\n- Each of S and T exists exactly once in A_{i, j}.\\n- 1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 300\\n- 1 \\\\leq R_i \\\\leq H\\n- 1 \\\\leq C_i \\\\leq W\\n- (R_i, C_i) \\\\neq (R_j, C_j) if i \\\\neq j.\\n- A_{R_i, C_i} is not #.\\n- 1 \\\\leq E_i \\\\leq HW\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n4 4\\r\\nS...\\r\\n#..#\\r\\n#...\\r\\n..#T\\r\\n4\\r\\n1 1 3\\r\\n1 3 5\\r\\n3 2 1\\r\\n2 3 1\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nYes\\r\\n\\nFor example, he can reach the goal point as follows:\\n\\n- Use medicine 1. Energy becomes 3.\\n- Move to (1, 2). Energy becomes 2.\\n- Move to (1, 3). Energy becomes 1.\\n- Use medicine 2. Energy becomes 5.\\n- Move to (2, 3). Energy becomes 4.\\n- Move to (3, 3). Energy becomes 3.\\n- Move to (3, 4). Energy becomes 2.\\n- Move to (4, 4). Energy becomes 1.\\n\\nThere is also medicine at (2, 3) along the way, but using it will prevent him from reaching the goal.\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n2 2\\r\\nS.\\r\\nT.\\r\\n1\\r\\n1 2 4\\n\\nSample Output 2\\n\\nNo\\r\\n\\nTakahashi cannot move from the start point.\\n\\nSample Input 3\\n\\n4 5\\r\\n..#..\\r\\n.S##.\\r\\n.##T.\\r\\n.....\\r\\n3\\r\\n3 1 5\\r\\n1 2 3\\r\\n2 2 1\\n\\nSample Output 3\\n\\nYes\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the i-th edge connects vertices A_i and B_i.\\nYou are also given a sequence of positive integers C = (C_1, C_2, \\\\ldots ,C_N) of length N. Let d(a, b) be the number of edges between vertices a and b, and for x = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, N, let \\\\displaystyle f(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (C_i \\\\times d(x, i)).

Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left (1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq 3). Cell (i, j) contains an integer A_{i,j}. It is guaranteed that \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{i,j} is odd. Additionally, all cells are initially painted white.\\nTakahashi and Aoki will play a game using this grid. Takahashi goes first, and they take turns performing the following operation:\\n\\n- Choose a cell (i, j) (1\\\\leq i, j \\\\leq 3) that is still painted white (it can be shown that such a cell always exists at the time of the operation). The player performing the operation scores A_{i,j} points. Then, if the player is Takahashi, he paints the cell (i, j) red; if the player is Aoki, he paints it blue.\\n\\nAfter each operation, the following checks are made:\\n\\n- Check if there are three consecutive cells painted the same color (red or blue) in any row, column, or diagonal. If such a sequence exists, the game ends immediately, and the player whose color forms the sequence wins.\\n- Check if there are white cells left. If no white cells remain, the game ends, and the player with the higher total score wins.\\n\\nIt can be shown that the game will always end after a finite number of moves, and either Takahashi or Aoki will win. Determine which player wins if both play optimally for victory.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nA_{1,1} A_{1,2} A_{1,3}\\r\\nA_{2,1} A_{2,2} A_{2,3}\\r\\nA_{3,1} A_{3,2} A_{3,3}\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf Takahashi wins, print Takahashi; if Aoki wins, print Aoki.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- |A_{i,j}| \\\\leq 10^9\\n- \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{i,j} is odd.\\n- All input values are integers.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n0 0 0\\r\\n0 1 0\\r\\n0 0 0\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nTakahashi\\r\\n\\nIf Takahashi chooses cell (2,2) in his first move, no matter how Aoki plays afterward, Takahashi can always act to prevent three consecutive blue cells. If three consecutive red cells are formed, Takahashi wins. If the game ends without three consecutive red cells, at that point, Takahashi has scored 1 point and Aoki 0 points, so Takahashi wins either way.\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n-1 1 0\\r\\n-4 -2 -5\\r\\n-4 -1 -5\\n\\nSample Output 2\\n\\nAoki\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs). Enclose your code within delimiters as follows. Ensure that when the python program runs, it reads the inputs, runs the algorithm and writes output to STDOUT.\\n```python\\n# YOUR CODE HERE\\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

Then, the number of empty seats becomes K again.\\n- Otherwise, guide the entire group at the front of the queue to the attraction. The front group is removed from the queue, and the number of empty seats decreases by the number of people in the group.\\n\\n\\n- Go back to step 1.\\n\\nHere, no additional groups will line up after the guidance has started.

Thus, he guides the front group to the attraction, leaving 4 empty seats.\\n- Next, the group at the front has 5 people, which is more than the 4 empty seats, so the attraction is started.\\n- After the attraction is started, there are 6 empty seats again, so the front group is guided to the attraction, leaving 1 empty seat.\\n- Next, the group at the front has 1 person, so they are guided to the attraction, leaving 0 empty seats.\\n\\nIn total, he starts the attraction four times before the guidance is completed.\\r\\nTherefore, print 4.\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n7 10\\r\\n1 10 1 10 1 10 1\\n\\nSample Output 2\\n\\n7\\n\\nSample Input 3\\n\\n15 100\\r\\n73 8 55 26 97 48 37 47 35 55 5 17 62 2 60\\n\\nSample Output 3\\n\\n8\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

The i-th user's name is S_i and their rating is C_i.\\nAtCoder RPS 2 is played as follows:\\n\\n- Assign the numbers 0, 1, \\\\dots, N - 1 to the users in lexicographical order of their usernames.\\n- Let T be the sum of the ratings of the N users. The user assigned the number T \\\\bmod N is the winner.\\n\\nPrint the winner's username.\\n\\nWhat is lexicographical order?\\n\\nLexicographical order, simply put, means \\\"the order in which words appear in a dictionary.\\\" More precisely, the algorithm to determine the order of two distinct strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters is as follows:\\n\\nHere, \\\"the i-th character of S\\\" is denoted as S_i. If S is lexicographically smaller than T, we write S \\\\lt T, and if S is larger, we write S \\\\gt T.\\n\\n-  Let L be the length of the shorter string among S and T. Check if S_i and T_i match for i=1,2,\\\\dots,L. \\n-  If there exists an i such that S_i \\\\neq T_i, let j be the smallest such i. Compare S_j and T_j. If S_j is alphabetically smaller than T_j, then S \\\\lt T. Otherwise, S \\\\gt T. The algorithm ends here.\\n  \\n-  If there is no i such that S_i \\\\neq T_i, compare the lengths of S and T. If S is shorter than T, then S \\\\lt T. If S is longer, then S \\\\gt T. The algorithm ends here.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN\\nS_1 C_1\\nS_2 C_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nS_N C_N\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the answer on a single line.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 100\\n- S_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 3 and 16, inclusive.\\n- S_1, S_2, \\\\dots, S_N are all distinct.\\n- 1 \\\\leq C_i \\\\leq 4229\\n- C_i is an integer.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n3\\ntakahashi 2\\naoki 6\\nsnuke 5\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nsnuke\\n\\nThe sum of the ratings of the three users is 13.

Thus, the first line should contain 9.\\n- After 2 years, the sea level is higher than now by 2, and (1,2) sinks into the sea. This makes (2,2) adjacent to a sunken section, and its elevation is not greater than 2, so it also sinks. No other sections sink at this point. Thus, two sections sink, and the second line should contain 9-2=7.\\n- After 3 years, the sea level is higher than now by 3, and (2,1) sinks into the sea. No other sections sink.

However, before this operation, if there is an element among S_1, S_2, \\\\dots, S_{P_i} that is strictly greater than V_i, Snuke will start crying.\\n- Replace each of the elements S_{P_i}, S_{P_i+1}, \\\\dots, S_N with V_i. However, before this operation, if there is an element among S_{P_i}, S_{P_i+1}, \\\\dots, S_N that is strictly greater than V_i, Snuke will start crying.\\n\\n\\n\\nFind the number of sequences of Q operations where Snuke can perform all operations without crying, modulo 998244353.\\nTwo sequences of operations are distinguished if and only if there is 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq Q such that the choice for the i-th operation is different.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN Q\\nP_1 V_1\\nP_2 V_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nP_Q V_Q\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the answer as an integer.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 5000\\n- 1 \\\\leq Q \\\\leq 5000\\n- 1 \\\\leq P_i \\\\leq N\\n- 1 \\\\leq V_i \\\\leq 10^9\\n- All input values are integers.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n8 3\\n1 8\\n8 1\\n2 1\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n1\\n\\nSnuke can perform the three operations without crying as follows:\\n\\n- Replace S_1 with 8.\\n- Replace S_8 with 1.\\n- Replace S_2, S_3, \\\\dots, S_8 with 1.\\n\\nNo other sequences of operations satisfy the conditions, so the answer is 1.

Each element of A and B is between 0 and M-1, inclusive.\\nYou can perform the following operations on A any number of times, possibly zero:\\n\\n- Choose an integer i between 1  and N, inclusive, and perform one of the following:\\n- Set A_i \\\\leftarrow (A_i + 1) \\\\bmod M.\\n- Set A_i \\\\leftarrow (A_i - 1) \\\\bmod M. Here, (-1) \\\\bmod M = M - 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, you cannot perform an operation that makes A no longer a good sequence.\\nDetermine if it is possible to make A equal to B, and if it is possible, find the minimum number of operations required to do so.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN M\\nA_1 A_2 \\\\dots A_N\\nB_1 B_2 \\\\dots B_N\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf the goal is unachievable, print -1.\\nOtherwise, print the minimum number of operations required as an integer.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 2 \\\\times 10^5\\n- 2 \\\\leq M \\\\leq 10^6\\n- 0\\\\leq A_i,B_i< M(1\\\\leq i\\\\leq N)\\n- A_i\\\\ne A_{i+1}(1\\\\leq i\\\\leq N-1)\\n- B_i\\\\ne B_{i+1}(1\\\\leq i\\\\leq N-1)\\n- All input values are integers.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n3 9\\n2 0 1\\n4 8 1\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n3\\n\\nYou can achieve the goal in three operations as follows:\\n\\n- Set A_1 \\\\leftarrow (A_1 + 1) \\\\bmod M.
