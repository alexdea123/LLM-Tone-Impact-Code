You have two integer arrays, nums and freq, of equal length n. Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.\\n\\nAddition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are added to the collection at step i.\\nRemoval of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i.\\n\\nReturn an array ans of length n, where ans[i] represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the i^th step. If the collection is empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1]\\nOutput: [3,3,2,2]\\nExplanation:\\nAfter step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2.

So ans[3] = 2.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: nums = [5,5,3], freq = [2,-2,1]\\nOutput: [2,0,1]\\nExplanation:\\nAfter step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2.\\nAfter step 1, there are no IDs. So ans[1] = 0.\\nAfter step 2, we have 1 ID with the value of 3.

For each target value, it calculates the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal to the target value. The minimum cost is calculated by iterating over each element in the array and choosing the minimum cost between increasing the element by 1 for a cost of `cost1` and increasing two different elements by 1 for a cost of `cost2`. The final result is the minimum cost over all target values, modulo `10^9 + 7`.",

The `pw2` array stores the powers of 2 modulo `MOD`, and the `pw2_inv` array stores the modular inverses of the powers of 2. The `power_product` function calculates the product of powerful arrays from `l` to `r` using the prefix products and modular exponentiation. Finally, the solution iterates over the queries and calculates the product of powerful arrays for each query using the `power_product` function and returns the result modulo `mod`."

Here is an example of such a solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteDayPairs(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:\n        freq = {}\n        for hour in hours:\n            freq[hour] = freq.get(hour, 0) + 1\n        count = 0\n        for hour, freq_hour in freq.items():\n            for i in range(1, 24 // hour + 1):\n                if i * hour in freq:\n                    count += freq_hour * freq[i * hour]\n        return count // 2\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. It first builds a hashmap of the frequency of each hour, and then iterates over the hashmap to find the pairs that form a complete day. The `// 2` at the end is to avoid counting each pair twice.",
        "```\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteDayPairs(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(hours)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(hours)):\n                if (hours[i] + hours[j]) % 24 == 0:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution uses a brute force approach to check every pair of hours in the input list. If the sum of the hours in a pair is a multiple of 24, it increments the count. The function finally returns the count of such pairs.\n\nHowever, this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, where n is the length of the input list. This may not be efficient for large input lists.\n\nA more efficient solution can be achieved by using a hashmap to store the frequency of each hour value modulo 24. Then, for each hour value, we can find the number of pairs that can form a complete day by multiplying the frequency of the complement hour value (24 - hour % 24) with the frequency of the current hour value. Here's the improved solution:\n\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteDayPairs(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:\n        freq = {}\n        for hour in hours:\n            freq[hour % 24] = freq.get(hour % 24, 0) + 1\n        count = 0\n        for hour, f in freq.items():\n            if hour == 0:\n                count += f * (f - 1) // 2\n            else:\n                count += f * freq.get(24 - hour, 0)\n        return count // 2\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and is more efficient for large input lists.",
        "```\nclass Solution:\n    def countCompleteDayPairs(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(len(hours)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(hours)):\n                if (hours[i] + hours[j]) % 24 == 0:\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n```\n\nThis solution uses a brute force approach to check every pair of indices in the input list. It iterates over the list with two nested loops, checking if the sum of the hours at the current indices is a multiple of 24. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of pairs that form a complete day.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.

However, since the input list is limited to a maximum length of 100, this solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints.",

If it is, it updates the `dp` table with the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the current prefix. Finally, it returns the value of `dp[-1]`, which represents the minimum number of valid strings needed to form the entire target string, or `-1` if it is not possible."

You are given two integers kx and ky where (kx, ky) denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array positions where positions[i] = [x_i, y_i] denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.\\nAlice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:\\n\\nThe player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves. Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves.\\nIn the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them. Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.\\n\\nAlice is trying to maximize the sum of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to minimize them.\\nReturn the maximum total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play optimally.\\nNote that in one move, a chess knight has eight possible positions it can move to, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.\\n\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: kx = 1, ky = 1, positions = [[0,0]]\\nOutput: 4\\nExplanation:\\n\\nThe knight takes 4 moves to reach the pawn at (0, 0).\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: kx = 0, ky = 2, positions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]\\nOutput: 8\\nExplanation:\\n\\n\\nAlice picks the pawn at (2, 2) and captures it in two moves: (0, 2) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 2).\\nBob picks the pawn at (3, 3) and captures it in two moves: (2, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 3).\\nAlice picks the pawn at (1, 1) and captures it in four moves: (3, 3) -> (4, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 1).\\n\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: kx = 0, ky = 0, positions = [[1,2],[2,4]]\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation:\\n\\nAlice picks the pawn at (2, 4) and captures it in two moves: (0, 0) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 4). Note that the pawn at (1, 2) is not captured.\\nBob picks the pawn at (1, 2) and captures it in one move: (2, 4) -> (1, 2).\\n\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\n0 <= kx, ky <= 49\\n1 <= positions.length <= 15\\npositions[i].length == 2\\n0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 49\\nAll positions[i] are unique.\\nThe input is generated such that positions[i] != [kx, ky] for all 0 <= i < positions.length.\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxMoves(self, kx: int, ky: int, positions: List[List[int]]) -> int:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

There will be no other change in the scores.\\nTakahashi, who prefers diversity in scores, wants to know how many different score values will appear among the players' scores at each moment. For each i=1,2,\\\\dots,T, find the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\\nFor example, if the players have 10, 20, 30, and 20 points at some moment, there are three different score values among the players' scores at that moment.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN T\\nA_1 B_1\\nA_2 B_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nA_T B_T\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint T lines.\\nThe i-th line (1\\\\leq i \\\\leq T) should contain an integer representing the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 1\\\\leq N, T\\\\leq 2\\\\times 10^5\\n- 1\\\\leq A_i \\\\leq N\\n- 1\\\\leq B_i \\\\leq 10^9\\n- All input values are integers.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n3 4\\n1 10\\n3 20\\n2 10\\n2 10\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n2\\n\\nLet S be the sequence of scores of players 1, 2, 3 in this order.\\nCurrently, S=\\\\lbrace 0,0,0\\\\rbrace.\\n\\n- After one second, the score of player 1 increases by 10 points, making S=\\\\lbrace 10,0,0\\\\rbrace.

Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left (1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq 3). Cell (i, j) contains an integer A_{i,j}. It is guaranteed that \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{i,j} is odd. Additionally, all cells are initially painted white.\\nTakahashi and Aoki will play a game using this grid. Takahashi goes first, and they take turns performing the following operation:\\n\\n- Choose a cell (i, j) (1\\\\leq i, j \\\\leq 3) that is still painted white (it can be shown that such a cell always exists at the time of the operation). The player performing the operation scores A_{i,j} points. Then, if the player is Takahashi, he paints the cell (i, j) red; if the player is Aoki, he paints it blue.\\n\\nAfter each operation, the following checks are made:\\n\\n- Check if there are three consecutive cells painted the same color (red or blue) in any row, column, or diagonal. If such a sequence exists, the game ends immediately, and the player whose color forms the sequence wins.\\n- Check if there are white cells left. If no white cells remain, the game ends, and the player with the higher total score wins.\\n\\nIt can be shown that the game will always end after a finite number of moves, and either Takahashi or Aoki will win. Determine which player wins if both play optimally for victory.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nA_{1,1} A_{1,2} A_{1,3}\\r\\nA_{2,1} A_{2,2} A_{2,3}\\r\\nA_{3,1} A_{3,2} A_{3,3}\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf Takahashi wins, print Takahashi; if Aoki wins, print Aoki.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- |A_{i,j}| \\\\leq 10^9\\n- \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{i,j} is odd.\\n- All input values are integers.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n0 0 0\\r\\n0 1 0\\r\\n0 0 0\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nTakahashi\\r\\n\\nIf Takahashi chooses cell (2,2) in his first move, no matter how Aoki plays afterward, Takahashi can always act to prevent three consecutive blue cells. If three consecutive red cells are formed, Takahashi wins. If the game ends without three consecutive red cells, at that point, Takahashi has scored 1 point and Aoki 0 points, so Takahashi wins either way.\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n-1 1 0\\r\\n-4 -2 -5\\r\\n-4 -1 -5\\n\\nSample Output 2\\n\\nAoki\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

The `dfs` function takes three arguments: `mask`, which represents the current state of the board (with 1s indicating white cells and 0s indicating painted cells), `score`, which is the current score difference between Takahashi and Aoki, and `turn`, which is 0 if it's Takahashi's turn and 1 if it's Aoki's turn.\n\nThe function returns `True` if Takahashi wins from the current state, and `False` otherwise. The base case is when there are no more white cells left, in which case Takahashi wins if the score is positive and Aoki wins if the score is negative.\n\nIn the recursive case, the function tries all possible moves for the current player, updates the mask and score accordingly, and recursively calls itself with the new state. If it's Takahashi's turn, the function returns `True` if any of the recursive calls return `True`. If it's Aoki's turn, the function returns `False` if any of the recursive calls return `False`.\n\nFinally, the code calls the `dfs` function with the initial state and prints \"Takahashi\" if Takahashi wins and \"Aoki\" otherwise.",

If S is lexicographically smaller than T, we write S \\\\lt T, and if S is larger, we write S \\\\gt T.\\n\\n-  Let L be the length of the shorter string among S and T. Check if S_i and T_i match for i=1,2,\\\\dots,L. \\n-  If there exists an i such that S_i \\\\neq T_i, let j be the smallest such i. Compare S_j and T_j. If S_j is alphabetically smaller than T_j, then S \\\\lt T. Otherwise, S \\\\gt T. The algorithm ends here.\\n  \\n-  If there is no i such that S_i \\\\neq T_i, compare the lengths of S and T. If S is shorter than T, then S \\\\lt T. If S is longer, then S \\\\gt T. The algorithm ends here.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN\\nS_1 C_1\\nS_2 C_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nS_N C_N\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the answer on a single line.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 100\\n- S_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 3 and 16, inclusive.\\n- S_1, S_2, \\\\dots, S_N are all distinct.\\n- 1 \\\\leq C_i \\\\leq 4229\\n- C_i is an integer.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n3\\ntakahashi 2\\naoki 6\\nsnuke 5\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nsnuke\\n\\nThe sum of the ratings of the three users is 13.

The DFS function traverses the graph starting from each unvisited vertex, and the `sum(result)` gives the total number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that vertex v is reachable from vertex u."
